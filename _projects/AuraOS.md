## Expectation vs Reality

### Expectation

Aura OS is to be designed as a basic OS that have a simple GUI and command line, Eventually i would like to introduce my own application file and array of applications.

### Reality

In reality, building an os isnt a simple thing to do, this will be a long term goal of mine, it wont have regular updates, just when i have the time to work on it, amongst my other projects, and i will post updates to the blog [here](https://ryvor.github.io/Posts/) whenever i implement an update.

## Features

- Supports GRUB 2.06 Multiboot 2
- Supports VGA TUI

## Screenshots

Screenshots go here.

## Building the OS

### Requirements

This specification is purely based on my current situation and i am aware you could most likely do it cross-platform so long as you have the required software installed - this will be updated and confirmed as i test cross-platform.

- [Windows 10 64-bit or later](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10)
- [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
  - sudo apt-get install -y gcc g++ nasm ld make
- [Visual Studio Code (latest)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [F5 anything extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=discretegames.f5anything)
- [qemu](https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/)

### Build

To build Aura OS, i have implemented the vscode `launch.json` file preset with a number of tasks.

- `WSL - Build`: this is used to build the kernel, is uses WSL2 to compile the sourcecode into raw binary files in `/out/raw`.
- `WSL - ISO`: This builds the OS files from `/out/raw` into an ISO file and outputs it to `/out/iso`.
- `WSL - Clean`: The Clean function removes all of the Temporary files and the output files completely
- `WSL - Clear`: Similar to clean, it clears out all of the temporary files within the `/src/` folder, but leaves all of the output files
- `Windows - Launch`: This will be executed completely in windows and it will launch the ISO file from within `/out/iso/` that matches the version within the `VERSION` file in the source root in QEMU. It gets QEMU from the C:\Program Files\qemu\ directory.
