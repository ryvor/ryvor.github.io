# Cookies Policy

Last updated: {{ page.last_modified_at }}

## Introduction

This Cookies Policy explains how ryvor.github.io (“we”, “us”, or “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our website at [website URL] (“Website”). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

## Why do we use cookies?

We use cookies to improve your experience on our Website, including:

- Keeping you signed in
- Understanding how you use our Website
- Customising content for you
- Enabling the features and functionality of the Website

## What types of cookies do we use?

We use the following types of cookies:

- **Essential cookies**: These are required for the Website to function properly and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Website will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

- **Analytical/performance cookies**: These allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Website. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Website. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.

- **Functionality cookies**: These are used to recognise you when you return to our Website. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).

## How to control cookies

You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see [aboutcookies.org](https://www.aboutcookies.org/). You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.

## Changes to this Cookies Policy

We may update this Cookies Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this policy frequently for any changes. Changes to this Cookies Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
